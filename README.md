# Glossory.py
A glossory project.

This project is for helping young python developers get started in creating their first app 
with the use of tkinter to start having a feel of how python works.

It is a great project and it helps new programmers build something tangeble and cool.

This can very well be modified, so feel free to modify the code and use.

I love this project and so would you, it will give you a very good learning experience.
